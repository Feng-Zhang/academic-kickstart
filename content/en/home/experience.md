Focusing on molecular characterization of feed efficiency related traits in beef cattle through whole genome-wide sequencing (WGS) data analyses:
- Estimated phenotypic and genetic relationships of residual feed intake measures and their component traits with fatty acid composition in subcutaneous adipose of beef cattle
- Imputed genotype from 50K bovine beadchip to whole genome wide sequence using FImpute, Beagle and Impute2 software
- Performed genome wide association analysis (GWAS) for feed efficient and carcass traits in Canadian beef cattle by GCTA software 
- Compared the accuracy of genomic prediction for feed efficiency and carcass merit traits in within and across beef cattle using GBLUP, BayesB, BayesR and BayesRC.
